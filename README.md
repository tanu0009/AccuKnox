# AccuKnox AI/ML Assignment

This repository contains my solutions for the **AccuKnox AI/ML Internship Assignment**, demonstrating practical Python programming, REST API integration, data processing, visualization, and database management.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- SQLite  
- REST APIs  
- Matplotlib  
- VS Code  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **books_api.py** – Fetches book data from a public REST API and stores it in an SQLite database.  
- **student_scores.py** – Retrieves data from a public API, processes it to compute average scores, and visualizes the results using a bar chart.  
- **csv_to_db.py** – Imports user data from a CSV file into an SQLite database.  
- **users.csv** – Sample CSV file containing user information.  
- **books.db** – SQLite database generated from API data.  
- **users.db** – SQLite database generated from CSV data.  

---

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Secure API consumption using trusted public APIs  
- Structured database creation and data insertion using SQLite  
- Clear assumptions documented for mock data generation  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib  
- Clean, readable, and modular Python code

## 🎯 Purpose
This project was developed to showcase my ability to:
- Work with real-world APIs  
- Handle structured data efficiently  
- Apply database concepts using Python  
- Explain technical implementations clearly
